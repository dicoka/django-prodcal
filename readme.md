This is my Django version of Python [Prodcal](https://github.com/vovok/prod-cal) library.
Calendars are stored in PostgreSQL Database and can be edited in admin web iterface.

The methods of class "ProdCal" allow to calculate number of working days and days off based on holidays and transfers of working days.
